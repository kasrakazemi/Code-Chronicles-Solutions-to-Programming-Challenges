# LockBreaker

## Introduction

LockBreaker is a Python code designed to break a safebox lock based on specific conditions outlined in a programming question from the Quera website. The code implements algorithms for rotating and checking combinations of digits in a safebox lock to determine if it can be unlocked under given conditions.

## Problem Statement

The code solves a programming challenge detailed in the Quera problem statement, which involves breaking a safebox lock by satisfying certain conditions. These conditions are related to rotating the lock's digits, performing additions, and checking divisibility by 6.

For detailed information on the problem statement, you can refer to the Quera website: [Problem Statement](https://quera.org/problemset/123801/)

## Code Functionality

The LockBreaker code includes the following key components:

1. **Cycle Function**: This function rotates characters in a string to simulate changing the lock's combination.

2. **Big Addition Function**: This function performs addition on large integers represented as strings, considering carry values.

3. **Main Logic**: The main logic iterates through possible combinations of lock digits, checks conditions specified in the problem statement, and determines if the lock can be successfully unlocked.

## Usage

To use the LockBreaker code:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the code.

3. Run the code by executing the Python script.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to provide input (two numbers), and the code will attempt to unlock the safebox lock based on the problem's conditions.

## Sample Usage

You can use the provided sample input and run the code to see how it works. The code will output either "Boro joloo :)" or "Gir oftadi :(" based on whether it can unlock the lock under the given conditions.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or want to enhance its functionality, please feel free to open a pull request or an issue.

## Acknowledgments

The LockBreaker code was developed to address a specific programming challenge on the Quera website. Thanks to Quera for providing the problem statement and opportunity to solve it.

Happy coding, and enjoy breaking the lock with LockBreaker!
